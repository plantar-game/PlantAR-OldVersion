This sample app illustrates how to use Vuforia to augment objects that are cylindrical in shape – in this case a standard soda can. Upon recognition, the app displays a soccer ball that spins around the can properly handling occlusion.

To use this app:

1. Print the target images located at developer.vuforia.com/resources/sample-apps

2. Cut the target along the indicated lines

3. Wrap the target around a typical can of soda

4. Point your device at the wrapped can

5. When the can is recognized the soccer ball is displayed
